# Page Object Model exercise

Selenium Automation exercise using the  [Page Object Model pattern](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/guidelines_and_recommendations/page_object_models/)

This is an exercise [Ilse](https://github.com/ilse-macias) is doing and I was interested in doing myself in order to better help her as she masters Automation testing.
